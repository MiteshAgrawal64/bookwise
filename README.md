Modular REST APIs:
Built a robust Library Management System using Java and Spring Boot, exposing RESTful APIs for book management, user operations, and transaction handling.

JWT-Based Authentication & Authorization:
Implemented secure JWT token-based authentication. Added a custom filter to intercept and validate requests based on JWT, ensuring secure access to APIs.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Integrated role-based authorization for three user types—Admin, Librarian, and Member—with access restrictions enforced through filters to protect sensitive endpoints.
